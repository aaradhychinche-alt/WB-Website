## Overview

Modern cloud platforms are tightly coupled graphs of services, ingress routes, secrets, and configuration maps. Today, most teams only discover that a minor configuration change broke an upstream dependency **after** deployment alerts fire.

**WhatBreaks** solves this by shifting resilience left. Rather than experimenting with chaos in production, WhatBreaks ingests declarative infrastructure manifests and runtime cluster state, compiles a deterministic dependency graph, and predicts the exact blast radius before a change is applied.

## Current Product Status: Kubernetes V1

**WhatBreaks V1 is available now for Kubernetes.**

The V1 engine provides native static analysis and cluster-state reconciliation for:
- **Deployments, StatefulSets & DaemonSets** (pod selectors, environment bindings, readiness probes)
- **Services & Ingress Controllers** (endpoint routing, host rules, TLS certificates)
- **ConfigMaps & Secrets** (volume mounts, envFrom references, secret key lookups)
- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** (operator-managed infrastructure)

> **Note on Roadmap**: Integrations for Terraform plans, Helm chart templating, AWS IAM/RDS topologies, and Docker Compose are in active development. WhatBreaks V1 focuses specifically on deterministic Kubernetes impact analysis.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Blast Radius Analysis
Simulate a proposed manifest mutation (e.g. modifying an ingress rewrite rule, updating a secret key, or deleting a service port) to trace every direct and indirect dependent resource.

### 2. Tier-Aware Risk Scoring
Classify impact across service criticality levels:
- **Tier 0**: Payment gateways, authentication, and core routing.
- **Tier 1**: User-facing APIs and transaction processors.
- **Tier 2**: Internal metrics, background queues, and logging workers.

### 3. Deterministic Dependency Graph
Unlike distributed tracing tools that require active production traffic, WhatBreaks computes dependency paths statically and deterministically from your infrastructure definitions.

### 4. Interactive Simulation Dashboard
A unified web console featuring:
- **Overview**: Real-time cluster health, sync status, and recent change logs.
- **The Change / Simulation Workspace**: Interactive "What if I change this?" engine.
- **Blast Radius Visualizer**: Visual topology graph with node inspection and tier breakdown.
- **Affected Services Drawer**: Immediate list of downstream services that would fail.
- **Audit Reports & Compliance**: Exportable diff reports for review and compliance sign-off.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

WhatBreaks includes a developer CLI for local validation and CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
# Install the WhatBreaks CLI (example)
curl -sSL https://whatbreaks.dev/install.sh | bash

# Scan local Kubernetes manifests to verify graph integrity
whatbreaks scan ./k8s/manifests/

# Predict blast radius for an uncommitted change or patch
whatbreaks blast-radius --change ./patches/ingress-auth-patch.yaml

# Run a simulated mutation against a specific resource
whatbreaks simulate --resource deployment/auth-service --attribute spec.template.spec.containers[0].ports

# Validate changes before merge in CI (exits non-zero if critical risk detected)
whatbreaks check --manifests ./k8s/ --risk-threshold medium
```

---

## CI / CD Integration

Prevent infrastructure outages before PRs merge:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/whatbreaks.yml
name: Infrastructure Impact Analysis
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'k8s/**'
      - 'manifests/**'

jobs:
  analyze-blast-radius:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run WhatBreaks Impact Analysis
        uses: whatbreaks/action@v1
        with:
          manifests-dir: './k8s'
          fail-on-risk: 'high'
        env:
          WHATBREAKS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.WHATBREAKS_TOKEN }}
```
